Javascript Project: Shoutbox

In addition to fulfilling the project requirements, I have made adjustments to the shout box appearance and functionality.
Specifically, I have...

- changed the background image
- changed the color palette
- used a custom font
- adjusted the appearance of the buttons, input boxes, and messages div in both color and shape
- retained the messages div scrolling capability while hiding the actual scroll bar
- included buttons that will automatically insert bold, italic, or underline tags on text highlighted by the user in the message input box
